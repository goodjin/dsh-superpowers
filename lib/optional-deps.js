/**
 * Peer dependencies without load-time risk.
 *
 * A preset mount is whole-tree: if this package fails to IMPORT, every sibling
 * row is rolled back and the web client retries without backoff — that is how
 * one unresolvable row became a resume storm (2026-09-29). So nothing at the
 * top level of the entry modules may be able to fail, and the only fragile
 * things there were these two libraries. They are imported through this
 * wrapper, which absorbs failure: the real library when it is installed, a
 * permissive stub (or plain absence) when it is not. Callers degrade instead
 * of dying at load.
 *
 * Loaded eagerly rather than at first use on purpose: apply() registers the
 * tool synchronously and the session snapshots its tool list right after the
 * mount — a registration that landed later would silently miss the session.
